## UI Updates

### Zones Tab
```
Zone Card:
├── Zone Icon & Name

```

## Technical Details

### Weather Transition Implementation
- **Instant**: Uses `SetWeatherTypeNow()` and `SetWeatherTypeNowPersist()`
- **Smooth**: Uses `SetWeatherTypeOverTime(weather, seconds)`
- **Synced**: Server broadcasts mode to all clients
- **Persistent**: Mode saved until changed

### Zone Weather Update
- **Client → Server**: NUI callback sends zone update
- **Server → All Clients**: Broadcasts zone change
- **Zone Detection**: Checks player position every 3 seconds
- **Priority**: Zone weather overrides global weather
