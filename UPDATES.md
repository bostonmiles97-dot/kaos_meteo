# WeatherSync - Latest Updates

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Weather Sync Fixed
**Problem**: Weather changes weren't syncing to all players
**Solution**:
- Added server-side logging to track weather broadcasts
- Improved client-side weather application with `SetWeatherTypeOverTime()`
- Added console logging to verify weather changes are received
- Weather now transitions smoothly over 5 seconds

### 2. Black Border Removed
**Problem**: Black border visible around UI in-game
**Solution**:
- Removed border from `.weather-sync-main` CSS
- Changed pointer-events to only be active when UI is visible
- Reduced background opacity slightly for better transparency

### 3. Time Controls Added to Main Tab
**New Features**:
- Quick time buttons: Day, Night, Noon, Midnight
- Custom time input: Set specific hour (0-23) and minute (0-59)
- Freeze/Unfreeze time button
- All time changes sync to all players

**UI Location**: Home tab → Current Weather section

### 4. Simple Time Commands Added
**New Commands**:
- `/set day` - Sets time to 12:00 (noon)
- `/set night` - Sets time to 00:00 (midnight)
- `/set 12am` or `/set midnight` - Sets time to 00:00
- `/set 12pm` or `/set noon` - Sets time to 12:00

**Note**: All commands require admin permissions (same as weather commands)
